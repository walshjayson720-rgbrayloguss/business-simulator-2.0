# business-simulator-2.0
Business Simulator is a progression-based idle and management game where you start with just $100 and build a growing resource empire from the ground up.

Begin by manually chopping wood, collecting leaves, and mining stone, then reinvest your earnings into automated structures like mines, tree farms, and collection centers that produce resources for you over time. Hire specialized employees—from beginners to expert workers—each designed to maximize production in mining, logging, or collecting.

As your business expands, your resources per minute increase, your inventory updates live, and your money grows even while you’re offline. Smart upgrades, strategic hiring, and efficient selling are key to scaling faster and unlocking higher-level operations.

With visual notifications, sound feedback, cooldown-based actions, saved progress, and long-term growth, Business Simulator rewards planning and optimization while staying easy to play and satisfying to expand.

Grow small operations into massive production chains and see how big you can make your business.
